I am a second-year MASc BME student at McMaster who is interested in Neuro-Current Response Functions and how they can be used alongside EEG/MEG to predict brain responses to varying stimuli.
I am currently researching the responses that Parkinson's patients elicit when performing rhythmic tasks, as well as the neural pathways involved.
I currently hold a BHSc degree from the HESE iBioMed program at McMaster, along with a minor in chemistry.
I am very interested in the intersection between biology, math, engineering, and statistics.
